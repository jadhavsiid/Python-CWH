# numbers.append(21) #This adds the number which is bieng input by user at the end of the list.

# numbers.remove(77) #Removes the desired number from the list.
# print(numbers)
#
# numbers.pop() #Removes the last element in the list.
# print(numbers)
#
# numbers[1]=98 #Changes the value of the mentioned index by adding new mentioned value.
# print(numbers)

# numbers.sort() #Sort all the numbers in the list in ascending order.
# print(numbers)
#
# numbers.reverse() #Sorts all the numbers in the list in descending order.
# print(numbers)

#list Slicing
# print(numbers[0:5]) #To Print the list starting from declared initialised and terminating index
# print(numbers[:5]) #Does the same job even initialised index is not mentioned.
# print(numbers[:]) #Does the same job even initialised and terminating index isn't mentioned.
# print(numbers[1:],'\n') #Skips the element on first index of the list and print it.

#Extended Slicing
# print(numbers[::]) #Prints the Complete list.
# print(numbers[::2]) #Prints Alternate numbers in the list.
# print(numbers[::3]) #Skips two numbers in the list and print it.
# print(numbers[::-1]) #Inverts the list and prints it.
